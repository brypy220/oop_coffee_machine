My Coffee Machine
====================


This project is my coffee machine.


It utilizes:

- Object Oriented Programming
- OOP allows me to split a larger tasks into smaller pieces which helps projects requiring a team
- I love procedural programming but it does have it's limits, especially when it comes too larger/complex projects
- OOP is essentially the Manager(me, the programmer) of a Restaurant(a program) hiring a chef, waiter, and busboy( all three are objects)
- the chef, waiter, and busboy have attributes(things it has) and methods(things it does)
- the chef's attributes would be: ``is_washing_dishes= True`` **and** ``sinks=[1,2,3,4]``
- the chef's method's would be: ``def apply_soap():`` and ``def rinse_dishes():``




Throughout the code there are various comments for my own personal use
